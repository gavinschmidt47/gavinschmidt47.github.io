            <p>ORIGINAL CARD GAME</P>
            <p>FACES: COMMANDERS is a fast-paced, head-to-head strategy game that combines the classic excitement of poker-hand card synergy with intense battlefield tactics. In this linear battle game, the strategic combination of cards unlocks additional dice, which are then rolled to determine the victor of each skirmish.</p>
            <p>Assemble formidable armies for each of your commanders—Ace, King, Queen, and Jack—by strategically adding cards, or "units," to their ranks. Leveraging unit synergy provides powerful boosts to your battle dice, giving your army the edge against opponents. Once your units are recruited, each commander faces off against their respective arch-nemesis (Aces versus Aces, Kings versus Kings, and so forth). The commander who emerges victorious in the most skirmishes claims supremacy in the epic War of Faces.</p>
            <p>Get ready to outmaneuver your rivals and lead your commanders to ultimate victory in FACES: COMMANDERS.</p>
