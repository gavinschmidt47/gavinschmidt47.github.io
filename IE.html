            <p><b>GROUP ORIGINAL VIDEO GAME</b></p>

            <p>Vampire Survivors inspired game with an inky twist. Players must navigate a randomized environment filled with electronic-based enemies and obstacles. The player must fight to upgrade their abilities and unlock allies to save the world of physical art from the oncoming electronic threat. Can you stop the electronic invasion? Or will you let the ink become digital and the world of physical art be lost forever?</p>

            <p><b>WHAT I DID</b></p>
            <p>I coded all of the player controls and enemy behaviors, ensuring an engaging gameplay experience. I also designed much of the levelling up system and helped with the overall game balance. In order to keep the player immersed in this battle, I created a song to showcase this conflict between the physical and digital realms. The synthesizer in the song overwhelms the physical brass and percussion, highlighting what can happen if the digital world takes over. The song is also just as fast-paced as the gameplay, keeping players on their toes.</p>
