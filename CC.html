            <p><b>GROUP ORIGINAL VIDEO GAME</b></p>

            <p>A balloon named Poppi, trapped by the evil Ringleader, who uses your torment as sick entertainment. You embark on a quest to escape from their clutches. take on the roles of various balloon animals in each level to escape and uncover the mysteries of the Ringleader.</p>
            <p>Every aspect of this game is designed with a nostalgic sense of classic carnival theming, but also with this uneasy sense of dread. Each tent seems inviting and plays music that seems familiar and friendly. However, you must not be fooled for each level will quickly reveal to the player its darker side. With details hidden within music, level design, and art, will you find what is happening to Poppi or will you continue to subject Poppi to this endless torment?</p>
            <p>Levels have the player play as a rhino, a monkey, or a cheetah. Each level will require their respective special ability to complete the level:</p>
            <p>Rhino: Charge</p>
            <p>Monkey: Climb</p>
            <p>Cheetah: Speed</p>
            <p><b>Can you push pass the Ringleader's endless torment to save the kids?</b></p>


            <p><b>WHAT I DID</b></p>
            <p>I came up with an idea for a momentum game that uses very loose controls and contains difficult parkour. When I was creating what became the Cheetah level for this game, we realized that it would be fun to have entirely different playstyles for each level. So, I began working with my team to create more level ideas, eventually creating the Rhino and Monkey levels as well. I created all of the mechanics in this game and tweaked how they work to fit my team's level designs. I also did all of the audio in this game, marking my first time creating an implementing my own sound effects.</p>
            <p>This project really tested my Unity knowledge and skills. As project lead, I was the person everyone turned to for assistance in making this game. On top of being the only mechanic and control coder, I also spent many hours assisting my team and helping them learn Unity. This project is a showcase of that leadership and hardwork put in over many hours.</p>
