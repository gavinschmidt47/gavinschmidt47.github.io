            <p><b>SOLO ORIGINAL VIDEO GAME</b></p>

            <p>Within the realms of Blast Space, the only matter of importance is your wealth of Cubes. The accumulation of this resource has created intergalactic megacorporations powerful beyond comprehension. However, they need a powerful <i>Blasters</i>, such as yourself to harvest this resources of inestimable valuable. Will you prove your worth to these corporations? Or will you waste your shot at an <i>Eternity of Peace</i></p>
            <p>The gameâ€™s mechanics are simple yet offer a challenge to players, whether new or returning. As a player, you must bide your time, waiting for the perfect moment when the maximum number of cubes are within the Blast Space. Then, with a single press of the space bar, your fate is permanently sealed, until you want to try another <i>Blaster</i>, that is. With little to no learning curve and randomized spawning, Blast Space is an easy-to-get-into game with a lot of replayability.</p>

            <p><b>WHAT I DID</b></p>
            <p>Every single aspect of this game, except for the tilemap, was made by hand for a class at UCF. We were given a week and a half to come up with a simple 'WarioWare'-inspired game and create it. I have always enjoyed timing-based games and working to beat my own or others' high scores. So, I designed a simple-looking game with fun, randomly spawning enemies that can collide with each other and move around. Since I created this project alone, I was able to ensure every aspect of the game fit my theme and worked together in harmony. The sprite of the Blaster and the enemy are meant to have a similar feeling and presence in the scene. However, they are notably different from the tilemap to create a feeling of unease and unnaturalness. Additionally, because the game is set to a timer and becomes very fast-paced, I made the music emphasize the unease and pressure of time.</p>
