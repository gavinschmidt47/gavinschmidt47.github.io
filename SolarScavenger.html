            <h2>Game Jam Experience</h2>
            <p class="overview-text">
                Solar Scavenger was created for the <strong>FIEA Game Jam 2026</strong>, an intense 48-hour 
                development challenge where our team of 4 built a complete space survival experience from scratch. 
                The game centers around a desperate escape from the dying Icarus-XIII star, with players navigating 
                through procedurally generated space sectors while being pursued by hostile scavengers and pirates.
            </p>
            <p class="overview-text">
                One of the most memorable aspects of this jam was the incredible support from the judges. Their 
                constructive feedback during playtesting helped us refine our momentum-based controls and balance 
                the resource management systems. Their insights on pacing and difficulty scaling were invaluable 
                in making the final hours of development count. The judges' enthusiasm for our procedural generation 
                approach and dynamic difficulty systems validated our technical decisions and gave us confidence 
                in the game's potential.
            </p>
            <p class="overview-text">
                As <strong>Programmer & Composer</strong>, I designed and implemented the procedural chunk-based 
                generation system, resource management mechanics, and momentum-based controls that define the core 
                gameplay. I also composed the adaptive music system that responds to game state, intensifying as 
                danger increases. The experience taught me the value of modular systems and performance optimization 
                in real-time procedural generation.

                    <h3>Procedural Generation</h3>
                    <p>
                        <strong>What I Learned:</strong> Building a chunk-based procedural generation system taught 
                        me about spatial hashing, efficient neighbor lookups, and seamless world streaming. The 
                        challenge was ensuring smooth performance while generating infinite space in real-time. 
                        Implementing adaptive chunk loading based on player velocity significantly improved the 
                        experience.

                    <h3>Performance Optimization</h3>
                    <p>
                        <strong>What I Learned:</strong> Object pooling became essential for maintaining 60fps 
                        with hundreds of asteroids, enemies, and collectibles. Rather than instantiating/destroying 
                        objects constantly, we reused them strategically. This pattern reduced garbage collection 
                        and kept the game buttery smooth even in intense combat scenarios.

                    <h3>Momentum-Based Physics</h3>
                    <p>
                        <strong>What I Learned:</strong> Creating satisfying momentum controls required careful 
                        tuning of acceleration curves, drag coefficients, and rotation speeds. The key was making 
                        the ship feel heavy and realistic while remaining responsive enough for evasive maneuvers. 
                        Playtesting feedback helped us find the perfect balance.

                    <h3>Adaptive Game Systems</h3>
                    <p>
                        <strong>What I Learned:</strong> Dynamic difficulty scaling based on player performance 
                        created a more engaging experience. Tracking metrics like survival time, resources collected, 
                        and damage taken allowed us to adjust spawn rates and enemy behavior in real-time, keeping 
                        players in the "flow state" regardless of skill level.

                    We're incredibly excited to announce that we're continuing development on Solar Scavenger! 
                    The positive reception at FIEA Game Jam 2026 and the encouraging feedback from judges has 
                    inspired us to expand the game into a full release. We've formed <strong>Goblin Candy Studios</strong> 
                    (temporary name!) to take this project to the next level.

                <p class="win-text">
                    Our post-jam roadmap includes expanded procedural generation systems, additional enemy types, 
                    a more robust upgrade system for the player's ship, and narrative elements that flesh out the 
                    lore of the dying Icarus-XIII star. We're planning deeper resource management mechanics with 
                    ship customization options and dynamic story events that respond to player choices.

            <h2>Developer Reflection</h2>
            <blockquote>
                Building Solar Scavenger in 48 hours was an exhilarating challenge that pushed our technical 
                skills and creativity to the limit. The procedural generation system became the backbone of 
                the entire experience, and watching infinite space unfold in real-time as players desperately 
                fled the dying star was incredibly rewarding. The judges' enthusiasm and constructive feedback 
                made this jam experience truly special—they didn't just evaluate our work, they invested in 
                helping us make it better. Their insights on balancing challenge and accessibility shaped our 
                dynamic difficulty system in ways we hadn't considered. Forming Goblin Candy Studios to continue 
                this project feels like a natural next step, and we're thrilled to take the momentum from this 
                jam and transform Solar Scavenger into something even more ambitious. This game proved that with 
                the right team, tight constraints breed incredible creativity. I can't wait to see where we take 
                this project next!
