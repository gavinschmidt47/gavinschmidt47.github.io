            <p><b>GROUP ORIGINAL VIDEO GAME</b></p>

            <p>"Illumen Horizons LLC" offers a horrifying experience in a dark, abandoned factory. What begins as a routine urban exploration quickly descends into a nightmare when the protagonist realizes they are not alone. Over the years, numerous investigations, rumors, and conspiracies have plagued Illumen Horizons LLC, but most were dismissed as absurdâ€”until now. Recently recovered footage reveals a mysterious beast that manifests differently for each viewer. Some see the beast move only when the camera is on it, others find the camera freezes the beast in place, and a few witness the beast stalking the urban explorer until they retrieve a flashlight. Watch the tape and tell us what you find. Be careful though, viewers have experienced ***<i><b>REDACTED</b></i>***</p>
            <p>The mechanics of the game are designed to keep the player on edge at every turn. With limited stamina, fast camera movements, and slower player speed, safety is never guaranteed. The game's most distinctive feature is its randomized beast behavior, which sets it apart from other horror games. Each time the game is launched, players face entirely new challenges, requiring them to adapt their strategies to navigate the maze successfully. Will you make it through the maze? Or will the beast ***<i><b>REDACTED</b></i>***?!</p>

            <p><b>WHAT I DID</b></p>
            <p>I created the idea for this horror game where an enemy has randomized behavior. I knew I could handle the coding and wanted a challenge beyond the basic requirements of this class project (make a hallway with a guard in it). So, I began writing code and implementing my own first-person player controller for the first time in my career. After refining the controls, I studied NavMesh and AI routing to manipulate the beast to behave exactly how I wanted. I then worked on post-processing and environmental effects, and assisted in ensuring the animations and particles of the beast fit what I was envisioning.</p>
            <p>This project pushed me outside my comfort zone, which is why I dedicated so much effort to creating the experience, especially given the time constraints. When composing the music for this game, I aimed to create a dynamic music system that alerts the player when the monster is near based on the music playing. I also ensured the horror and uncertainty permeated every aspect of the game by maintaining close and constant communication with the artists and level designers.</p>
