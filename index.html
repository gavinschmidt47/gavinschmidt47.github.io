        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Welcome to my portfolio! I am a student at the University of Central Florida studying in Digital Media - Game Design with a focus on programming. I am also minoring in Computer Science. I am enterring into my senior level clases and I will graduate May 2026. This portfolio showcases much of my classwork I have done, as well as personal projects. Much of my work is focused on the coding, but I notate where I did other parts of the project.</p>
        <p>I decided to become a Game Design major because of my passion for video games from a young age and what you can achieve through such a medium. Creativity and logistics are exactly what I strive to achieve in everything I do and video games are that perfect intersection. I have ensured that I am a valuable asset to every possible part of the development process and to the company as a whole. I have worked as much as I can in between schooling to gain broad experience throughout a multitude of industries in order to obtain the skills necessary to complete any task given to me throughout my career. I have no doubt that I can bring something to the table in every situation.</p>
