        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Welcome to my portfolio! I am a student at the University of Central Florida studying in Digital Media - Game Design with a focus on programming. I am also minoring in Computer Science. I am enterring into my senior level clases and I will graduate May 2026. This portfolio showcases much of my classwork I have done, as well as personal projects. Much of my work is focused on the coding, but I notate where I did other parts of the project.</p>
        <p>I decided to become a Game Design major because of my passion for video games from a young age and what you can achieve through such a medium. Creativity and logistics are exactly what I strive to achieve in everything I do and video games are that perfect intersection. I have ensured that I am a valuable asset to every possible part of the development process and to the company as a whole. I have worked as much as I can in between schooling to gain broad experience throughout a multitude of industries in order to obtain the skills necessary to complete any task given to me throughout my career. I have no doubt that I can bring something to the table in every situation.</p>

            <h3>Corporate: World Dominion</h3>
            <p>A reworking of the classic board game, Risk, Corporate: World Dominion offers a more Monopolistic conflict. Your goal is to spread your business as far as possible and to eliminate local and global competition through any means necessary.</p>

            <p>In a world focused on profits and international sales, only one corporation can truly claim the World Dominion.</p>

            <h3>FACES: COMMANDERS</h3>
            <p>A linear battle game using poker-hand card synergy, FACES: COMMANDERS is a quick head-to-head strategy game. Combining card synergies allows for more dice which then get rolled to determine who wins each battle.</p>
            <p>Create armies for each of your commanders to fight enemy commanders by adding cards, or “units”, underneath each commander. Your commanders are Ace, King, Queen, and Jack. Using unit synergy can provide boosts to your battle dice to give your army a leg up against the opponent(s). After recruiting your units, each commander will compete against its respective arch nemesis (Ace will fight all enemy Aces, King will fight all enemy Kings, etc.). Whoever survives the most skirmishes wins the War of Faces.</p>
