            <p><b>WHAT I DID</b></p>
            <p>The entire design and mechanical function of the game were done by me. We were assigned to reimagine a classic board game within 2 weeks. I chose a personal favorite and iconic board game, Risk. I also decided that I would like to add an economy system in some way. After extensive brainstorming, I found a way to enhance the game through an economy and building system.</p>
